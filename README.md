# About What-To-Do!
This is a simple Todo app made with vanilla React. I plan to add more features than just the CRUD operations.

This app doesn't have a backend. It utilizes your browser's local storage to make data persist temporarily.

## Features to Implement
* Progress Bar
* Dynamic Status
* Filters
* Sorting
* Alerts
* Dark Theme
* Drag 'n Drop
* Deadline
* Sub-todo

## Tech Stack
* React
* TailwindCSS

## How to Run
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

First, clone the project.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

It runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
